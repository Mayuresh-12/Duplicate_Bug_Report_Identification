# Duplicate Bug Report Identification


Developers are constantly working on bug fixes and pushing updates to the software to make the software more reliable and as close to being flawless as they can. However, the process is not as simple from the developer’s perspective. The process of fixing bugs can take anywhere between just a few hours to a few days. This only scales up as more and more people start reporting bugs in the software.There are situations where multiple people independently report bugs with a title and a description of the bug to the developer. A developer might receive hundreds of bug reports each day, out of which many can be the exact same bug, described using a different set of words. This might not seem like a big problem, but it definitely affects the efficiency of the developers as they spend a lot of time going through the same bugs they are already trying to fix for hours or days. This is not an ideal situation as over a period of time it will decrease the developer’s efficiency. However, the developer cannot gauge which bug reports are duplicates unless they spend time going through the details of the incoming bug report. This process takes a lot of time when bug reports are in the hundreds or even thousands at times. This is a problem that can be solved using machine learning.

This project is aimed at creating a model to classify bug reports as duplicate or non-duplicate.
